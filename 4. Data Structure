 1. How Pando Stores Data
    -> Pando stores each table's data as compressed columnar blocks
    -> Each physical block contains tuples from only one table

 Doubt ?? what about join that we studied if one block contain same table data  =>  Stores the join predicate (a cross-table condition) inside the index tree of T1, but still only stores T1's tuples in the blocks.

2. How Pando Builds Indexes
   -> For each table, Pando builds 𝑘 logical partitioning trees.
   -> Each tree is a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a predicate, called a cut ( condition that splits data logically ).

3. What Do the Leaf Nodes Represent?
   -> Each leaf in the tree represents a specific logical expression built by combining all the predicates along the path from the root to the leaf.
   -> Each leaf node has a list of blocks (e.g., B0, B4) that contain tuples matching its expression.
   -> Some blocks may contain extra rows that don't satisfy the expression. But no blocks are missed — all relevant ones are included.
